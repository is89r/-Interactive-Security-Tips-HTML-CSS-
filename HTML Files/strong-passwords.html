    <h2>What is a strong password?</h2>
    <p>A strong password is one that is hard to guess and not easy to crack. It usually includes a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.</p>

    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
    <p>Weak passwords are one of the top causes of data breaches. Hackers often use automated tools to try common or short passwords. Using strong passwords reduces this risk.</p>

    <h2>Tips to create strong passwords:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use at least 12 characters</li>
      <li>Include letters, numbers, and special characters</li>
      <li>Avoid names, birthdays, or repeated patterns</li>
      <li>Use a password manager to generate and store passwords</li>
    </ul>
