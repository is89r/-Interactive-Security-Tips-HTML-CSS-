    <h2>What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?</h2>
    <p>2FA is a security process in which the user provides two different authentication factors to verify themselves. It adds an extra step in logging in, making it harder for attackers to access your account.</p>

    <h2>Why is 2FA important?</h2>
    <p>Even if your password is stolen, 2FA helps protect your account by requiring a second step—like a code from an app or SMS. It reduces the risk of unauthorized access.</p>

    <h2>Common types of 2FA:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Authentication apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy)</li>
      <li>SMS verification codes</li>
      <li>Hardware security keys (e.g., YubiKey)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to get started:</h2>
    <p>Check your account security settings and enable 2FA wherever it’s supported. Use an app for better security instead of SMS if possible.</p>
